# Semester1FinalProject

The final project for my first semester as a **Computer Science Engineering** student at *Ã“buda University*.

---

**Used technologies**
 - **C#**
 - **.NET Framework**

---

The program is a **Console Application** that implements a variant of the **game Nim**. 
- The players can remove objects from the board which are located in the same row or column.
- The application prompts the players to make their move by *entering the coordinates* which mark the *beginning* and the *end of the sequence of objects they wish to remove.*
- The *last player who removes objects* from the board decleared as *winner*.
